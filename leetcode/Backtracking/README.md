# Idea

The backtracking algorithm is a type of depth-first search (DFS).
The backtracking algorithm works by exploring all possible paths to a solution, and for each path, it checks whether it leads to a valid solution.
If it does not lead to a valid solution, the algorithm backtracks and tries another path.


# Use cases

The backtracking algorithm can be used to solve a wide range of problems, such as the n-queens problem, the traveling salesman problem, and the subset sum problem.
