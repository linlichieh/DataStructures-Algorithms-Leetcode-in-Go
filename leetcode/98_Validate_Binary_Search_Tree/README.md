# Solution 1

Perform an in-order traversal, so the array is sorted. Iterate through the list, ensuring that each element is greater than the previous one.

# Solution 2

Define the range for the left and right subtrees. For example, the left subtree should contain values less than the root value, and the right subtree should contain values greater than the root value.
