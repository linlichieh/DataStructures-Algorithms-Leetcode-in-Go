# Hint

Keep track of the minimum price you have seen so far and the maximum profit you can get each day.

# Step-by-Step Approach:

1. Initialize two variables, one for the minimum price and another for the maximum profit.
2. Iterate through the list of stock prices.
3. During each iteration, update the minimum price if the current price is lower than the minimum price seen so far.
4. Calculate the profit by subtracting the minimum price from the current price. If this profit is higher than the maximum profit recorded, update the maximum profit.
5. Continue this process for each price in the list.
