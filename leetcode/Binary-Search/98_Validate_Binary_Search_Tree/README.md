# Solution 1

Perform an in-order traversal, the array should be sorted if it's a valid BST.
Iterate through the list ot check each element that is greater than the previous one.

# Solution 2

Define the range for the left and right subtrees and loop through each node.
The left subtree should contain values less than the root value and the right subtree should contain values greater than the root value.
