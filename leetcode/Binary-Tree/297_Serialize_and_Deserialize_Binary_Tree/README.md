# Additional explanation for the question

The `Clarification` in the description means that it doesn't need to follow the format of input/output since it uses BFS in the description.

As a result, it can be other approach like DFS or anything you want as long as it can be serialized and deserialized by your own methonds.

# Idea

Use either BFS or DFS (preorder) to solve this problem.

DFS (preorder) is better than BFS based on the result.

# Result

DFS

* Runtime: 7ms (beats 88.11%)
* Memory: 7.8MB (beats 31.89%)

BFS

* Runtime: 865ms (beats 5.41%)
* Memory: 120.3MB (beats 5.41%)
